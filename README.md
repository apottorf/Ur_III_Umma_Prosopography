## Introduction to the Dataset
* This dataset is preliminary and derived from the [BDTNS](http://bdtns.filol.csic.es/index.php?p=formulario_urIII)
* To access this dataset, please request permission from [Google Drive](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1u0mRGfCRF3cth4vgn2FS1usqCp4FStlP/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=109221485517740985449&rtpof=true&sd=true)
* This dataset is prosopographical in nature. It tabulates data relating to texts and personal names so that scholars can search for personal names according to a variety of qualitative and quantitave data. Each personal name is assigned a PIN ("Personal Identification Number"), which disambiguates that individual from all others. To demonstrate the kind of results such data permit, the following table presents an abbreviated excerpt regarding Namhani (1264):

| BDTNS # | Name      | Relative Name     | Social Stratum | Notation and Related Terminology | Land (gan2/iku) Allotment | PIN  | PIN Frequency |
| :------ | ----------| ------------------| ---------------| -------------------------------- | ------------------------- | ---- | ------------: | 
| 038525  | Nam-ha-ni | KA-u2-du11 (1265) | Citizen & -    | MAÅ c                             | gan2                      | 1264 | 5             |
| 169983  | Nam-ha-ni |                   | Citizen & +    |                                  | 6 iku                     | 1264 | 5             |
* Note that this table is highly abbreviated from the full dataset, which includes more isolated data pertaining to each text and personal name. With access to the full dataset, scholars can filter the data according to one or more criteria, such as social strata, occupation, and allotments. For example, if scholars investigate the occupations of UN-il2, they can filter all PIN's according to known UN-il2 and then search all attested occupations for such PIN's in the dataset.
* This dataset uses sigla with the following meanings: & = An inference based on explicit data, & - = an internal inference, & + = an external inference, * = a confident restoration, (?) = an uncertainty
* Cells may be highlighted in a variety of colors to indicate various levels of possible attention. Cells highlighted in yellow are skipped and do not require immediate attention. Cells highlighted in green and red require more attention, but may not be reconciled quickly. Cells highlighted in blue or purple require hte most urgent resolutions, but the timing of such resolutions depends on a variety of factors.
